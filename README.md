# A React Keyboard

This is a personal project that I created to test Tailwind CSS. It is an SPA written in React that displays a simplified keyboard. The `Keyboard` component listens for key events to type the keys you click on your keyboard into a text field. You can also click on the individual buttons to type something into the text field.
